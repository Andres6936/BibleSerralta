# About the Site

On this site, some originally published biblical notes are presented
at https://www.bibleserralta.com, written by R. L. Serralta Nogu√©s.

I have decided to take the job of improving the appearance of the site, maintaining
the original essence and improving every aspect I would have liked to appreciate
in the original site, in order to help spread the ideas of this great author.

My knowledge of HTML5 and CSS is limited, which is why I made the decision.
to take on the appearance of sites appreciated by me like https://www.mozilla.org,
great part (or all) of the appearance of the site is based on them.
