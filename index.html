                    <h3>Help you to understand the prophecy</h3>
                    <p>This book will help you to understand that prophecy and help
                        you teach it to the brethren under your spiritual
                        responsibility; regarding such an important issue as is the
                        Second Coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>This book is and is not</h3>
                    <p>This book is not about a writer trying to twist the Bible so
                        that the Scriptures agree with his interpretation of the
                        prophecy.<br>What the writer does is display before the
                        readers' eyes what the media has published, so that they
                        can check for themselves the reliability of the
                        interpretation.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>It is a concise and clean book</h3>
                    <p>The book is written in a very clear, pedagogical, and
                        condensed manner.<br>In this way you can absorb in a
                        couple of hours, all its information just by reading it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>You won't waste time reading</h3>
                    <p>You can trust that the time invested in reading this book
                        will yield more than a hundred times your investment.<br>
                        You won't have to make yourself believe the interpretation;
                        it will come to you just by reading.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>The Arrival of Christ</h3>
                    <p>You will be able to prove that we are in the third of the
                        four last steps of human history before the coming of
                        Christ.</p>

        <p>The author has the ability to impart his knowledge and experiences in a
            short and concise manner that is easy to understand.  To put it in his
            own words let me share with you what he once told me: 'I do not dissolve
            an aspirin in a barrel of water, so as to force whoever wants the benefits
            of the aspirin, to drink the whole barrel. I just give them the
            aspirin.  That's why I write as brief as possible'.</p>
