        <p>If you want the book "Daniel 7: The Last Four World Powers " , just ask
            for it, and we will send it to you free of charge.<br>
            The address is available at the end of this page.<br>
            This is a book in which for the first time it is demonstrated
            with facts the true interpretation of the Daniel 7 prophecy and how it
            is being fulfilled before our eyes.<br>
            The four beasts of the prophecy really represent
            England , Russia , China and the European Union.<br>
            This book will help you to understand that prophecy and help you
            teach it to the brethren under your spiritual responsibility;
            regarding such an important issue as is the Second Coming of Our
            Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
            This book is not about a writer trying to twist the Bible so
            that the Scriptures agree with his interpretation of the prophecy.<br>
            What the writer does is display before the readers' eyes what the media
            has published, so that they can check for themselves the reliability of
            the interpretation.<br>
            The book is written in a very clear, pedagogical, and condensed manner.
            In this way you can absorb in a couple of hours, all its information
            just by reading it.<br>
            You can trust that the time invested in reading this book will yield
            more than a hundred times your investment.<br>
            You won't have to make yourself believe the interpretation;
            it will come to you just by reading. <br>
            You will be able to prove that we are in the third of the four last
            steps of human history before the coming of Christ.<br></p>

        <p>The author has the ability to impart his knowledge and experiences in a
            short and concise manner that is easy to understand.  To put it in his
            own words let me share with you what he once told me: 'I do not dissolve
            an aspirin in a barrel of water, so as to force whoever wants the benefits
            of the aspirin, to drink the whole barrel. I just give them the
            aspirin.  That's why I write as brief as possible'.</p>
