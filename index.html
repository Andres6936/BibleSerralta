                This is a book in which for the first time it is demonstrated
                with facts the true interpretation of the Daniel 7 prophecy and how it
                is being fulfilled before our eyes.  <br>
                The four beasts of the prophecy really represent
                England , Russia , China and the European Union.<br>
                This book will help you to understand that prophecy and help you
                teach it to the brethren under your spiritual responsibility;
                regarding such an important issue as is the Second Coming of Our
                Lord Jesus Christ. <br>
                This book is not about a writer trying to twist the Bible so
                that the Scriptures agree with his interpretation of the prophecy.<br>
                What the writer does is display before the readers' eyes what the media
                has published, so that they can check for themselves the reliability of
                the interpretation.<br>
                The book is written in a very clear, pedagogical, and condensed manner.
                In this way you can absorb in a couple of hours, all its information
                just by reading it.<br>
                You can trust that the time invested in reading this book will yield
                more than a hundred times your investment.<br>
                You won't have to make yourself believe the interpretation;
                it will come to you just by reading. <br>
                You will be able to prove that we are in the third of the four last
                steps of human history before the coming of Christ.<br>
